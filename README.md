### Wiki Index

A simple Java-based application for indexing and searching Wikipedia dumps in multiple languages. Unlike resource-intensive full-text search engines such as elasticsearch, the application allows for efficient search with minimal RAM and CPU usage. It exposes REST endpoints for document indexing and BM25 retrieval.
